Physical inactivity is on the rise worldwide, and this has a profound impact on the prevalence
 of non- transmissible diseases (NTD) and on global health.
 This application includes an accelerometer-based pedometer which calculates the amount of steps
 an individual takes in a day and compares it to the international 
standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) The application then informs the user
 if his/her daily activity has matched up to these standards and provides feedback and information
 regarding ways in which to improve. 
We believe that our application can represent an innovative tool for individuals to increase their 
daily amount of physical activity and thus an important preventive measure against NTD
